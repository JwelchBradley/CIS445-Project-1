        <h2>Life Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I want to travel the world while working at different game studios. I get bored
            when doing the save thing over and over again so this seems like a great path for me 
            to take. Some of my most preferred locations are the West Coast, Montreal, Japan,
            London, and Sweden. They all just seem like cool places to live and have a large amount 
            game studios.
