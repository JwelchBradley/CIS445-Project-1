        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy playing games just as much as I enjoy creating them. This is surprising even 
            to me since I have been playing games daily from the age of six. My primary passion 
            is programming and optimizing games, but I also enjoy creating videos with Adobe Premiere. 
            My first coding experience in high school sparked my excitement for this industry. We were 
            briefly taught to use python, and I became fascinated with getting programs to work 
            properly. The never-ending cycle of having a problem to solve and finding the correct 
            solution is something that I love.

        <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy playing games (<a href="https://jwelchbradley.myportfolio.com/about">Check out my favorites here</a>), 
            hiking, exercising, cooking, DnD, and going to gym. If I'm not doing any of those, then I'm probably researching something or trying
            to pick up a new skill because I always enjoy learning new things. I am also a part of a few extracurricular activities. I play as
            the IGL for my school's Valorant team and as one of the tank player's on our Overwatch 2 team
