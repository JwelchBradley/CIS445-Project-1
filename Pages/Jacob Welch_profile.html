        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy playing games just as much as I enjoy creating them. This is surprising even 
            to me since I have been playing games daily from the age of six. My primary passion 
            is programming and optimizing games, but I also enjoy creating videos with Adobe Premiere. 
            My first coding experience in high school sparked my excitement for this industry. We were 
            briefly taught to use python, and I became fascinated with getting programs to work 
            properly. The never-ending cycle of having a problem to solve and finding the correct 
            solution is something that I love.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Currently, I am a Senior at Bradley University where I have gotten over 4 years of experience 
            creating games inside of the Unity game engine. Video games I have made using Unity include 
            State Shift, Asteroids, a platformer, an infinite runner, a tower defense game, and a few other 
            various projects. These were done in my primary major of Game Design, but I also have done coding 
            projects for my second major, Computer Information Systems. Most of these have involved data 
            structures such as linked stacks, linked queues, and linked trees.

        <ul>
            <li>Learning new things all the time</li>
            <li>Honest communication and feedback</li>
            <li>Games that are both fun and competitively viable</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Beliefs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning new things all the time</li>
            <li>Honest communication and feedback</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>
            My goal after I get my undergraduate degrees is very open at the moment. I am looking into a few main
            options though. The first is to get a job/internship in the gaming industry. This is likely my long-term
            goal for the rest of my life because games are the thing that I love in life. I enjoy playing them daily
            and have just as much fun making them so it only makes sense that that would be my most important goal.
            That being said, the gaming industry is very difficult to get into which is why I am also looking at software
            development jobs and internships. These are a great second alternative because I also enjoy programming a lot
            and think they could serve as a great stepping stone towards getting myself into the gaming industry. Having
            more professional experience in any development capacity will look better to hiring managers in the game industry.
            Lastly, my fall back option is to go for my master's degree in game design. I likely won't be getting it at Bradley
            University, but I can't say where yet because I am still in the early steps of researching different options.

        <h2>Interests/Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy playing games (<a href="https://jwelchbradley.myportfolio.com/about">Check out my favorites here</a>), 
            hiking, exercising, cooking, DnD, and going to gym. If I'm not doing any of those, then I'm probably researching something or trying
            to pick up a new skill because I always enjoy learning new things. I am also a part of a few extracurricular activities. I play as
            the IGL for my school's Valorant team and as one of the tank player's on our Overwatch 2 team
