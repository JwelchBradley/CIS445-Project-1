                <h1>Cybershot</h1>
                <p>Cybershot is 5-week pvp parkour first-person bow shooter. In it, the player can go for 
                    stylish outplays by flexing on their opponents with superior movement techs.
                    This project took a lot of work learning how to network video games
                    and how to implement fun first-person combat. By clicking the link below,
                    you will be able to play the game!

                <h1>Wicked Wizards</h1>
                <p>Wicked Wizards is currently my capstone project for my 38-person team.
                    It is based on the prototype I worked on called Wizards of Wizardly.
                    The game is a 4-player CO-OP Towerd Defense FPS where you play
                    as evil wizards against an onslaught of cute fairytale creatures. It is a bloody, gory mess
                    that you won't want to miss!

                <h1>Constellation Exploration</h1>
                <p>Constellation Exploration is a VR Constellation learning experience.
                    It was developed by me and 9 other developers over the course of a semester
                    for our schools spring expo. The biggest selling point for this project
                    was our accuracte sky map that had all of the stars place relative to
                    how they would actually look in the night sky.

                <h1>Zero Gravity</h1>
                <p>Zero Gravity is a 5-week prototype I worked on with 5 other developers.
                    It features a flying third-person shooter in space. The world is procedurally
                    generated and the player has a set of three abilities they can utilize.
                    There isn't much gameplay content as it was a mechanical prototype.
